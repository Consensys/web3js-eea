# Generated SDK documentation sources

This directory contains base files to generate SDK doc with CI.

- index.html is the root redirect file
- TARGET_README.md is the readme that will be renamed and copied to the gh-pages branch
- README.md will not be copied, it's this file.
- .circleci directory contains a configuration for CircleCI that does nothing but prevents CI to fail.

The actual up to date generated doc is available at [`https://consensys.github.io/web3js-eea/`](https://consensys.github.io/web3js-eea/)
