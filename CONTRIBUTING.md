## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
#### Before Submitting A Bug
* Ensure the bug is not already reported by searching [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea/issues).

#### How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug?
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea/issues).

* If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a
**title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or
an **executable test case** demonstrating the unexpected behavior.
* Describe the **exact steps** to **reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When
listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, the exact
the exact commands used on the command line or Truffle console.
* Provide **specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or
copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue,
use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/).
* Describe the **behavior you observed** after following the steps and explain the
problem with that behavior.
* Explain the **behavior you expected** instead and why.
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem
happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Suggesting Enhancements
#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
* [Search](https://pegasys1.atlassian.net/browse/PAN-2502?jql=project%20%3D%20PAN) to see if the enhancement has already been
suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea/issues). Create an issue on and provide
the following information:

* Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a **step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement in as much detail as possible.
* Describe the **current behavior** and explain the **behavior you expect** instead and why.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.
* Specify the **name and version of the OS** you're using.
* Specify the **name and version of any relevant packages**

### Pull Requests

Complete the CLA, as described in [CLA.md].

There are a number of automated checks:
* unit tests
* code formatting

If these checks pass, pull requests will be reviewed by the project team against criteria including:
* purpose - is this change useful
* test coverage - are there unit/integration/acceptance tests demonstrating the change is effective
* code consistency - naming, comments, design
* changes that are solely formatting are likely to be rejected

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but
bigger changes should contain more detail.

## Git Commit Messages & Pull Request Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Provide a summary on the first line with more details on additional lines as needed
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
